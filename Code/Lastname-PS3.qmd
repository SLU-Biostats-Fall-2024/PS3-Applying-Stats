# Problem Set 3

## Here I will demonstrate everything I have learned about basic statistical analysis using R

My workflow model to follow: plot data (and guess the results) → build the statistical model → Check the model assumptions → Interpret the model → Make a final plot

In this project, I will examine data featuring 5 species of bats and use some data analysis to learn more.

start with a clean environment and package installation

```{r}
rm (list = ls()) # cleans environment completely
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(ggfortify)
library(multcomp)
```

Next, I'll read in and check out the data I need using the here() function

```{r}
bats<- read.csv(here("data","bat_data.csv"))
glimpse(bats)
```

Taking a quick look at this data - there are 9 variables and 125 rows of data. There are 5 categorical variables and 4 continuous variables.

I want to change at least a few of these data types using as.factor()

```{r}
bats$Species<-as.factor(bats$Species)
bats$common_name<-as.factor(bats$common_name)
bats$age<-as.factor(bats$age)
bats$sex<-as.factor(bats$sex)
bats$type<-as.factor(bats$type)
```

Next, I'll check the factor data for consistency

```{r}
levels(bats$Species)
levels(bats$common_name)
levels(bats$age)
levels(bats$sex)
levels(bats$type)
```

These are clean- no mistakes in entry!

Now to check out the numeric variables - I want to ensure there are no odd outliers made by mistake

```{r}
ggplot(bats,aes(x=mass_g,y=tick_num))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()
```

There don't appear to be any strange outliers here

```{r}
ggplot(bats,aes(x=body_length_mm,y=tail_length_mm))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()
```

Again, nothing concerning in terms of outliers in the data

## Now that I'm confident in the data, I'll start looking into Aria's questions:

Workflow model to follow: plot data (and guess the results) → build the statistical model → Check the model assumptions → Interpret the model → Make a final plot

## **1. Does body mass differ between these five species of bats and, if so, how does body mass differ between the species?**

To figure this out, I'll first plot this proposed relationship, knowing species (the predictor) is a categorical variable and mass (the response) is a continuous variable, so I'll use a boxplot, and will later run an ANOVA (there are 5 treatments of Species).

```{r}
ggplot(bats,aes(x=Species,y=mass_g))+
  geom_boxplot()+ #creates a boxplot
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()
```

Interesting! I would definitely expect a difference in the mean mass between at least two of these species. At minimum there should be a difference between LACI and LANO, MYLU, and PESU, and at maximum I could see a statistically significant difference between each of them.

Next, I'll build my statistical model. Since I'm going to run an ANOVA, I'll need to start with a linear model

```{r}
bats.MOD <- lm(mass_g~Species, data=bats)
```

I'll need to check my assumptions before running any tests

```{r}
autoplot(bats.MOD)
```

These look great! A linear model is appropriate, there is normality in the data, there is even variance, and no points with major leverage.

Now I can move onto my tests

```{r}
anova(bats.MOD)
```

Woooop! We have a (very) significant p value.

Okay, great! But how does body mass differ between the species?

I'll have to run a post-hoc test to find out.

This is a Tukey test

```{r}
PHC1<-glht(bats.MOD, linfct = mcp(Species="Tukey")) #mcp = multiple comparisons
summary(PHC1)

```

I could do an interpretation here, but it is a lot of information to take in, so I'll ask for a compact letter display

```{r}
cld(PHC1)
```

Cool! This tells us that each of the species are statistically different in means of mass.

Let's make a final model and conclusion to wrap up

```{r}
sumbats1<-bats%>%
  group_by(Species)%>%
  summarise(
    meanbats = mean(mass_g),
    mass_g=mass_g,
    sebats=sd(mass_g)/sqrt(n())
  )

ggplot(sumbats1,aes(x=Species,y=mass_g,colour=Species))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=meanbats-sebats,ymax=meanbats+sebats))+
  theme_bw()
```

I reject the null hypothesis that mean body mass does not differ between these five species of bats, and suggest each species correlates with a different mean body mass (F=792.9, dF120,4, p\<2.2e-16).

## **2. Does body length differ between these five species of bats and, if so, how does body mass differ between the species?**

I'm pretty sure this was supposed to say body **length** twice

To figure this out, I'll first plot this proposed relationship, knowing that species (the predictor) is a categorical variable and body length (the response) is a continuous variable, so I'll use a boxplot, and will later run an ANOVA (there are 5 treatments of Species)

```{r}
ggplot(bats,aes(x=Species,y=body_length_mm))+
  geom_boxplot()+ #creates a boxplot
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()
```

Reviewing this graph, I would expect a difference in the mean mass between at least two of these species, likely between LACI compared to LANO, MYLU, and PESU. In fact, I would expect difference between them all, with a possible exemption for MYLU and PESU

Next, I'll build my statistical model. Since I'm going to run an ANOVA, I'll need to start with a linear model

```{r}
bats.MOD2 <- lm(body_length_mm~Species, data=bats)
```

I'll need to check my assumptions before running any tests

```{r}
autoplot(bats.MOD2)
```

These look great! A linear model is appropriate, there is normality in the data, there is even variance, and no points with major leverage.

Now I can move onto my tests

```{r}
anova(bats.MOD2)
```

Woooop! We have a (very) significant p value.

Okay, great! But how does body length differ between the species?

I'll have to run a post-hoc test to find out.

This is a Tukey test

```{r}
PHC2<-glht(bats.MOD2, linfct = mcp(Species="Tukey")) #mcp = multiple comparisons
summary(PHC2)

```

I could do an interpretation here, but it is a lot of information to take in, so I'll ask for a compact letter display

```{r}
cld(PHC2)
```

Ahhh, this is what I suspected. All are different other than MYLU and PESU!

New model and conclusion time!

```{r}
sumbats2<-bats%>%
  group_by(Species)%>%
  summarise(
    meanbats = mean(body_length_mm),
    body_length_mm = body_length_mm,
    sebats=sd(body_length_mm)/sqrt(n())
  )

ggplot(sumbats2,aes(x=Species,y=body_length_mm,colour=Species))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=meanbats-sebats,ymax=meanbats+sebats))+
  theme_bw()
```

I reject the null hypothesis that mean body mass does not differ between these five species of bats, and suggest that there is a statistically signficant difference in body length between each of the species other than MYLU and PESU (F=70.498, dF120,4, p\<2.2e-16).

## **3. Is the number of ticks found on the bats associated with their sex or age?**

To figure this out, I'll first plot this proposed relationship, knowing that sex and age (the predictors) are categorical while tick count (the response) is a discrete variable, so I'll use a histogram, and will later run a chi square

prep the data for plotting

```{r}
sumbats3<-bats%>%
  group_by(sex, age)%>%
  summarise(total =sum(tick_num))
sumbats3
```

lets plot the data for now

```{r}
ggplot(sumbats3, aes(x = sex, y=total,fill=age)) + 
  geom_bar(stat='identity',position="dodge")+
  theme_bw()
```

In these graphs, it looks like there is a significant difference in mean tick num between males and females, but not between adults and subadults

Next, I'll build my statistical model. Since I'm going to run a x\^2 test, I'll need a matrix, so i'll use xtabs()

```{r}
bats.mat<-xtabs(tick_num~sex+age,data=bats)
bats.mat
```

next, i can use the matrix to run the x\^2 test

```{r}
chisq.test(bats.mat)
```

Lets make a new plot and conclude

```{r}
ggplot(sumbats3,aes(x=sex,y=meanbats, fill=age))+
  geom_bar(stat='identity',position="dodge")+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=meanbats-sebats,ymax=meanbats+sebats,width=0.2))+
  theme_bw()
```

I do not reject the null hypothesis that the number of ticks found on the bats is not associated with either their sex or age (X-squared = 0.33718, df = 1, p-value = 0.5615).

## **4. Disregarding species, is there a relationship in bats between tail length and body length?**

To figure this out, I'll first plot this proposed relationship, knowing that tail length and body length are continuous variables, so I'll use a scatterplot, and will later run a linear regression model.

```{r}
ggplot(bats,aes(x=tail_length_mm,y=body_length_mm))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()
```

Oooh! There appears to be a strong positive relationship. (180-60)/(100-11)=120/89 = 1.35 I estimate the slope to be \~1.35 and the y intercept to be around 30.

Next, I'll build my statistical model. Since I'm going to run an ANOVA, I'll need to start with a linear model

```{r}
bats.MOD4 <- lm(body_length_mm~tail_length_mm, data=bats)
bats.MOD4
```

So, here the slope is 1.455 and the y-int is 33.300. My guesses weren't too far off!

I'll need to check my assumptions before running any tests

```{r}
autoplot(bats.MOD4)
```

These charts look good! A linear model is appropriate, there is normality in the data, there is even variance, and no points with major leverage.

Now I can move onto my tests

```{r}
summary(bats.MOD4)
```

Woooop! We have a (very) significant p value.

New graph and conclusion here:

```{r}

ggplot(bats,aes(x=tail_length_mm,y=body_length_mm))+
  geom_point()+ 
  geom_smooth(method='lm')+
  theme_bw()
```

I reject the null hypothesis that mean body length and tail length have no relationship, and suggest that as body length increases, so does tail length (F=1037, df1,123, p\<2.2e-16).
